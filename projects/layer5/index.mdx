Layer 5 represents the "session" layer of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSCI) Model. It establishes, coordinates, and manages communication of sessions between 2 or more applications or processes. Sessions consist of requests and responses between apps or processes. The session data can then be sychronized and merged into a single stream.

Layer5.io is an open-source community that builds and maintains tools related to cloud-native application infrastructure. When a project grows, so does its infrastructure needs. Layer5.io has developed an ecosystem giving developers tools to configure, manage, and test workload performances.

## Contribution

I'm interested in learning more about infrastructure and was looking for an issue I could contribute to. Unfortunately, I didn't know RUST or have enough understanding yet. However, their main site is created with Gatsby. So I looked for some front-end issues I could help with and joined the Layer5.io community.

### Issue üö©

‚ùå <a style="color: #ffa726; text-decoration: none" href="https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/2435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Handbook icons not responsive </a>

One of their webpages had issues with its icon responsiveness. When inspecting the page, the code was written with inline-styles and the icons pixels were being reduced with css "rem" units. HTML white-spaces and line-break elements were also seen throughout.

### Solution üí°

I needed to clean this area up and do some consolodation. When I was inspecting the page, I saw that the markdown files were being styled using SASS with MUI styled-components. I wanted to double those files and check for a solution that may already exist. There wasn't any so I rolled my own and created a class that targeted everything I needed.

After fixing the icon styles and removing the HTML white-spaces and line-breaks, I added aria-label tags where they were missing before I tested and submitted a PR.
