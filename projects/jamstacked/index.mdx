## Concept ðŸ’¡

I wanted to explore and learn about these concepts as well as the serverless landscape developers are using to deploy their builds. Great timing too because I wanted to build a new portfolio-site. So I ended up creating and deploying a couple of builds and contributing to one of Netlify's open-source projects along the way ðŸŽ‰.

In this write up, I'll be looking over 2 Jamstack projects I created including my portfolio-site and some of the tech used.

### Jamstack <a href="https://jamstack.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="border-radius: 6px; vertical-align: -12px" src="https://do3z7e6uuakno.cloudfront.net/uploads/event/logo/1093832/2a813938a009bfe6d3e60be5902a502d.png" alt="jamstack logo"/></a> <a href="https://www.netlify.com/jamstack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img style="vertical-align: -9px" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/netlify/netlify-icon.svg" alt="netlify cli" width="35" height="auto"/></a>

It's an architecture style that is powered with Javascript, APIs, and Markup. Prerendered content is packaged into optimized bundles and is served to a CDN. After the static content is received, its then hydrated with javascript functionality.

This way content is served much faster and apps are easier to scale and distribute without the need of servers and databases.

## Frontend Development

### Gatsby <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="vertical-align: -12px" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1624021714-cover.png" alt="gatsby.js logo"/></a>

Static-site generators, such as Next.js or Hugo, are used to generate a full HTML website written with javascript. I decided to do this with Gatsby. It leans on React, has excellent documentation, and a huge community.

Other perks of Gatsby include some baked-in APIs such as react-router, createPage, GraphQL, and GatsbyImage to name a few.

### React-Bootstrap <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="vertical-align: -12px" src="https://crowdcast-prod.imgix.net/-KHhIzuATU2K4OVPd2sP/event-cover-5388" alt="reactstrap logo"/></a>

This was a new library for me to learn. I had prior experience designing with reactstrap and react class-components, but for this project, I was teaching myself react-hooks. When comparing the documentation, although similar, ReactBootstrap utilizes hooks and is the reason I chose their library.

### Material UI <a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="vertical-align: -12px" src="https://mui.com/static/logo.png" alt="mui logo"/></a>

After some practice building my recipe-site with react-hooks and a new library, I wanted to learn and use Material UI for my personal site. My favorite feature is the navbar.

## APIs and Backend Development

### GraphQL <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="vertical-align: -12px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/GraphQL_Logo.svg/2048px-GraphQL_Logo.svg.png" alt="graphql logo"/></a>

GraphQL is an API query language and uses a type system to define data. It has its own data layer that executes queries during server-side runtime. GraphQL queries take in arguments and query-parameters then respond back with JSON data objects.

Probably the most valuable knowledge gained from building these projects. When a query is sent, an exact and predictable response is returned. Queries can be constructed to pull data from multiple resources with a single API call. There's also an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to test queries and mutations.

### API Plugins <a style="margin-left: .25rem; font-size: 28px; text-decoration: none" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins" alt="gatsby plugins"> ðŸ”Œ </a>

APIs are the functionality behind the static pages. There are many types available and each is aimed at providing a microservice that doesn't take much time to setup. Some of these services include: online payments, image processing, database connections, analytics, offline performance, etc.

### Node.js & MongoDB Plugins <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-nodejs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="border-radius: 999px; vertical-align: middle" src="https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/780/57/png-transparent-node-js-javascript-database-mongodb-native-miscellaneous-text-trademark.png" alt="nodejs logo"/></a> <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="vertical-align: middle" src="https://code4developers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MongoDBicon.png" alt="mongodb logo"/></a>

Node.js is baked into Gatsby and handles most of the initial data rendering. However there's a plugin that allows the creation of a custom Node/Express server which can be used to connect to a preferred backend. I used it to connect with a MongoDB Atlas cluster. Anytime new data is added, new resource links, pages, and directories are automatically generated.

## Deployment <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/build" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/netlify/netlify-icon.svg" alt="netlify build" width="auto" height="35"/></a> <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img style="vertical-align: middle" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1624021714-cover.png?w=300" alt="gatsby cloud"/></a>

In a nutshell. Both Netlify and Gatsby cloud provide cloud services and hosting solutions built on top of some major cloud providers as AWS and GCP. What they've done is create ways to effortlessly deploy and scale using serverless functions. This means you can spend time doing other tasks.

Both of these projects are hosted on Netlify and Gatsby Cloud. Setting everything up and deploying was a breeze. Each repo is monitored by its provider and updated when production ready changes are pushed.

I'll be doing other write-ups when I try to deploying static-sites using AWS S3, Azure, and GCP.

## Conclusions ðŸ’­

It's pretty easy to understand why there's been a lot of traction in the Jamestack movement. It's a way to deliver fast websites without fussing with server setups. API plugins also keep everything simple and secure.

Using GraphQL for API queries as an alternative to REST definitely has its place and can understand why Facebook spent its resources developing and implementing this tech into their apps.

If you're migrating a wordpress/html site, building a blog, e-commerce site, or a project that doesn't expect many updates, IMO, Jamestack is something to strongly consider.
