## Mission

I was listening to an interview on Software Engineering Daily (SED) and the host was interviewing an Engineer from Netlify. They were discussing building projects with Jamstack and deploying to cloud providers like AWS or Netlify.

I wanted to explore and learn about about these conepts, build and deployments strategies. I ended up building and deploying a couple of projects, including this website, with Jamstack technologies and contributing to Netlify CLI ðŸŽ‰.

In this write up, I'll be looking over the 2 Jamstack projects built.

## Jamstack <a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="margin-left: .25rem; border-radius: 6px; vertical-align: -12px" src="https://do3z7e6uuakno.cloudfront.net/uploads/event/logo/1093832/2a813938a009bfe6d3e60be5902a502d.png" alt="jamstack logo" width="40" height="auto"/></a>

Its an architecture style that is powered with Javascript, APIs, and Markup. It's easy to develop with, content is served faster, easier to scale, and more secure than the traditional approach. Prerendered content such as, static files, are served to a CDN and hydrated when its building, orloading, using serverless functions, hooks, and APIs.

## Goals

These are some core features and concepts I wanted to learn and practice:

- Material UI
- GraphQL - Schemas, Queries and Mutations
- API Plugins
- Gatsby Plugins
  - images
- Programmatically create:
  - resource pages
  - resource fs directories
  - links
  - fs directories
- Connect with MongoDB
- Deploy Build
  - Netlify
  - Gatsby Cloud
- Docker

In the end, when a user make a request to the browser, appropriate static contents will be sent back to the user and hydrated while the app is building, or loading. During deveopment, when production changes are ready, the project repo is monitored and deployed with Netlify or Gatsby Cloud.

## Static Sites with Gatsby <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="margin-left: .25rem; border-radius: 50%; vertical-align: -12px" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/205/1624021714-cover.png?w=300" alt="gatsby.js logo" width="40" height="auto"/></a>

There are several static-site generators as Next.js or Hugo, I decided to do this with Gatsby for good reason. It's React based, there's excellent documentation, and there's a huge community! It also comes with alot of built-ins related to file-system, images, and routing to name a few.

I used React-Bootstrap for the recipe-site, and Material-UI for my portfolio-site as the main style libraries. I'm currently in the middle of migrating from material-ui v3 and updating my useStyles to styled-components.

## GraphQL <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img style="margin-left: .25rem; border-radius: 50%; vertical-align: -12px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/GraphQL_Logo.svg/2048px-GraphQL_Logo.svg.png" alt="graphql logo" width="40" height="auto"/></a>

This is probably the most valuable knowledged gained from building these projects. When you send a query, you get an exact and predictable result back... that's it! To test queries and mutations, there are tools similar to Gatsby's GraphiQL IDE browser tool developers can use such as Apollo's GraphQL Playground.

Data was being queried from local files, metatdata, and MongoDB Atlas clusters. The data was then used to build directories, index pages, navigation links, and size images for each resource.
