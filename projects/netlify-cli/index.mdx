  When building and hosting applications, developers often face challenges to deliver content quickly to their users. CDN configs can be a pain to connect, setup, run, then manage while serving content.

  Netlify offers features and services for developers and organizations who are looking to build, host, scale, and test applications in a serverless environment. No config needed. Netlify detects frameworks and serverless functions while AWS and Google Cloud provide the CDN under the hood. This approach lets engineers build with the power of Jamstack API's and plugins, while using serverless functions as *glue-code* to distribute applications across the cloud with less work.

  Netlify CLI allows developers to do all of this from the terminal.
